####  Thank you for verify my test.
There is still alot of thing that can be improved, e.g. test can adapt with anti-automation system from amazon

I am using below framework:
 - Cucumber
 - Rspec
 - Selenium Webdriver

How to run the test:
 1. Make sure you already have chromedriver installed and added on your path
 2. Make sure you already have Ruby Installed
 3. Install below package:
    - gem install cucumber
    - gem install selenium-webdriver
    - gem install rspec
    OR using bundler install
 4. On the signin feature, you need to change yourEmail@gmail.com and yourpassword with your own valid credentials
 5. run test with cucumber syntax

Thank you...
