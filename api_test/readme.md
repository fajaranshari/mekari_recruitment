####  Thank you for verify my test.
There is still alot of thing that can be improved, e.g. separate each api call per step

I am using below package:
 - Cucumber
 - Rspec
 - HTTParty

How to run the test:
 1. Make sure you already have Ruby Installed
 2. Install below package:
    - gem install cucumber
    - gem install httparty
    - gem install rspec
    OR using bundler install
 3. run test with cucumber syntax
Thank you...
